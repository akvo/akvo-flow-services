# Running Locally

This document describes how to set up [akvo-flow-services](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-services) and [akvo-flow](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/) so you can use akvo-flow-services in a completely local setting.

1. docker-compose up
2. You should now be able to generate reports in the akvo-flow dashboard.
